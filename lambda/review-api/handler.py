"""review-api Lambda (spec §4.1, §4.4 step 6).

CRUD behind API Gateway for the review dashboard: list a PR's findings, fetch
one finding with its proposed diff, record a human's approve/edit/reject
decision, and read a finding's audit trail.

This is the "human approves" half of the project's core principle -- the agent
proposes, a person disposes. Every decision writes an immutable ReviewEvent
(spec §5) alongside the status change, so nothing is silently decided.

Wired to an API Gateway HTTP API (payload format 2.0), one Lambda handling
every route via `routeKey` dispatch. Every route sits behind a Cognito JWT
authorizer, so by the time this code runs the caller has a verified identity --
which is where a review's `actor` comes from. See _actor_from_claims.

      it: approve and edit are blocked on it (§3), and only a redraft against
      the accepted base can fix that. mapped is what remediation-agent picks
      up, and _chain_root now starts that redraft from the last accepted fix.
    - A finding this fix superseded (superseded_by == this id) goes to mapped
      and loses superseded_by. It never had a fix of its own -- this fix
      cleared its rule as a side effect, and after an edit that may no longer
      be so; after a rejection it certainly is not. The next run drafts it a
      fix for the first time. No stale_reason: there is no proposed_fix to
      put it on.

    Every reopen writes a ReviewEvent with actor "system". That event is the
