## What it does

IaCPosture scans Terraform for security misconfigurations, maps every finding to the specific OWASP or CIS control it violates, and proposes a minimal fix — one it has already proven clears the issue before a human ever sees it.

**The core design principle: the agent proposes, it never decides.**

- A deterministic scanner (tfsec, Checkov) finds the issue — zero hallucination risk on detection
- An LLM agent maps the finding to the exact control it violates, with a citation
- A second LLM agent drafts a minimal diff — then re-runs the same scanner against its own proposed fix before surfacing it. If the fix doesn't clear the finding, or introduces a new one, it never reaches a human as a suggestion.
- Every finding and every fix is reviewed and approved by a human — nothing is auto-merged

## Why

Most "AI security scanner" tools ask an LLM to both find and judge issues in one pass, with no way to verify the model's claims. IaCPosture splits detection (deterministic, provable) from remediation (LLM-drafted, but self-checked against the same scanner that found the problem) — so a proposed fix is never just an LLM's word that it worked.

               human approves / edits / rejects → audit log
```

Built serverless on AWS — API Gateway, Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge, CloudWatch/X-Ray, CloudFront — doubling as hands-on AWS Developer Associate (DVA-C02) practice.

## Status

🚧 Pre-build / architecture phase. v1 scope is Terraform-only (detect → map → propose fix → human review); Kubernetes/Helm scanning is planned for v2.

## Roadmap

- [ ] v1 — Terraform scanning, mapping, remediation, review dashboard (manual trigger, no GitHub write-back)
- [ ] v2 — Kubernetes manifest + Helm chart scanning
- [ ] v3 — GitHub App / PR-triggered CI integration
- [ ] v4 — Approved-fix write-back to PR branch

## Tech stack

- **Infra:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge, CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudFront
- **Scanning:** tfsec, Checkov (Terraform); kubesec, Helm (v2)
- **Agents:** Anthropic API, strict JSON-schema-constrained outputs
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
