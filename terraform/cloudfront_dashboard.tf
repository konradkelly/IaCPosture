# Static hosting for the review dashboard (spec §4.1 "CloudFront + S3").
#
# The bucket is PRIVATE and stays that way. CloudFront reads it through an
# Origin Access Control, which signs each origin request with an identity the
# bucket policy trusts; nobody else can read the bucket at all.
#
# The older way to do this is a public bucket serving the S3 website endpoint.
# Don't. It would trip aws-s3-block-public-acls / aws-s3-block-public-policy,
# which this project's own corpus maps to CIS-AWS 2.1.5 -- terraform-scanner
# would flag our own infrastructure. It also lets people bypass CloudFront by
# hitting the bucket URL directly, and the S3 website endpoint can't do HTTPS.
