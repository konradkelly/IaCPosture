# Cognito user pool + Hosted UI for the review dashboard (spec §4.1, §8).
#
# The spec lists Cognito as an optional v1.1 item. Pulled into v1 because the
# API it fronts serves a list of unfixed vulnerabilities with their file paths,
# and its review route marks findings resolved. Throttling is not a substitute
# for either half: one unauthenticated request is enough to resolve a real
# finding, and an audit trail whose actor is a self-asserted string records
# claims rather than facts. The JWT's identity is what makes it evidence.

  # The exact origins the dashboard is served from. Both the CORS allow-list
  # and Cognito's callback/logout URLs derive from this list, so the two can't
  # drift. Cognito matches redirect_uri verbatim -- a mismatch shows up as a
  # Hosted UI error page, not a silent fallback.
